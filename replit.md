- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom CSS variables and design tokens
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Build Tool**: Vite with custom configuration for development and production

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Language**: TypeScript with ESM modules
- **API Design**: RESTful API endpoints
- **Request Handling**: Express middleware for JSON parsing, CORS, and logging
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling middleware

### Data Storage Solutions
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (configured for production) with Neon Database support
- **Schema Management**: Drizzle Kit for migrations and schema changes
- **Development Storage**: In-memory storage implementation for development/testing
- **Session Management**: Connect-pg-simple for PostgreSQL session storage

## Key Components

### Frontend Components
- **Navigation**: Fixed header with smooth scrolling navigation
- **Hero Section**: Professional introduction with call-to-action buttons
- **About Section**: Three-column layout showcasing core competencies

- **Contact Messages**: Form submissions with read status tracking
- **Chat Messages**: Bidirectional chat with user/system message differentiation
- **Validation**: Zod schemas for runtime type checking and form validation

## Data Flow

1. **Client Requests**: Frontend makes API calls using TanStack Query
2. **Server Processing**: Express routes handle requests with validation
3. **Storage Operations**: Drizzle ORM manages database interactions
4. **Response Handling**: JSON responses with appropriate HTTP status codes
5. **Client Updates**: React Query manages cache invalidation and UI updates
6. **Real-time Features**: Chat widget polls for new messages periodically

## External Dependencies

### Core Framework Dependencies
- React ecosystem (React, React DOM, React Hook Form)
- Express.js with middleware (CORS, session management)
- Database tools (Drizzle ORM, Neon Database client)

### UI and Styling
- Radix UI component primitives for accessibility
- Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
- Lucide React for consistent iconography
- React Icons for brand icons

### Development Tools
- Vite for fast development and building
- TypeScript for type safety
- ESBuild for production bundling
- PostCSS with Autoprefixer

### Analytics and Monitoring

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- Vite development server with HMR (Hot Module Replacement)
- Replit integration with development banner
- TypeScript checking and compilation
- Database migrations with Drizzle Kit

### Production Build Process
1. **Frontend Build**: Vite compiles React application to static assets
2. **Backend Build**: ESBuild bundles server code with external packages
3. **Asset Optimization**: CSS/JS minification and optimization
4. **Static File Serving**: Express serves built frontend assets

### Environment Configuration
- Database URL configuration for PostgreSQL
- Google Analytics measurement ID
- Session management with PostgreSQL store
- CORS configuration for cross-origin requests

### Scalability Considerations
- Stateless server design for horizontal scaling
- Database connection pooling through Neon
- CDN-ready static asset structure
- Modular storage interface for different backends
